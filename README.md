# Operational-Planning-Tool
### This is a Cloud Infrastructure Project for the operational planning for companies.

This project is intended for better planning in craft businesses by comparing working times, sick leave and later possibly also working locations. In addition, a stock is also installed, which means that material can also be used per project and the current stock is updated. As an extra, which may still be entered, is the automatic order when there is a minimum stock and an order stop when there is a maximum stock

For this I use the following technologies and languages: 

Cloud : AWS 

Language: Python, Go programming language Terraform

and much more.
